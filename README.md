## Challenge
Develop an simple Bank application while following strictly the 9 rules below. You should end up with a pretty good Object Oriented Bank application.

1. Use only one level of indentation per method
2. Don’t use the else keyword
3. Wrap all primitives and strings
4. Use only one dot per line
5. Don’t abbreviate
6. Keep all entities small
7. Don’t use any classes with more than two instance variables
8. Use first-class collections
9. Don’t use any getters/setters/properties

## Bank application
Think of your personnal bank account experience. When in doubt go for the simplest solution.

- Basic account operation (deposit, withdrawal)
- Transfer to another client in the same bank
- Account statements (include all operations with date, amount and balance for each)
- Printing account statements (to console)
- Statement filters (time period, amount less than/greater than)
